                Life sciences are experiencing a <i>reproducibility crisis</i>. It has become
                challenging understand how most analyses were performed and even more
                difficult to repeat the same process again.

                This site was designed to help scientists share, document, distribute and rerun
                data analysis scripts. We call these scripts <b>recipes</b> with the following requirements:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each recipe must be fully operational.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each recipe may be modified, changed and shared across different projects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each recipe has test data associated with it demonstrating the starting information
                    and the results of the recipe.
                </li>
            </ul>

                The site supports running every type of command line oriented tool
                and process.
                Moreover it allows
                users to create full data analysis pipelines rather than
                single step analytics.
            </p>

            <p>
                Users may adapt and remix
                recipes to match their own needs, then share them as an alternative.
                By supporting these interactions we foster
                a collaborative environment that facilitates productive interactions
                and creativity.
