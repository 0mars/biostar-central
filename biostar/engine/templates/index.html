            Bioinformatics is experiencing a <strong>reproducibility crisis</strong>. It has become challenging to
            understand how analyses are performed and even more difficult to replicate the same processes again.

        </p>

        <p>
            This web application allows scientists to document, execute
            and share data analysis scripts. We call these analysis scripts
            <strong>"recipes."</strong>

        </p>
        <p>
            Users may adapt, modify and remix recipes to match
            their needs, then share these on the same site. By supporting these interactions, we foster a collaborative
            environment that facilitates creativity, efficiency and reproducibility.

        <p>
            Our software can generate <b>an easy-to-use graphical interface</b> to command line tools
            and thus provides access to a wide audience. Note that the recipes are <i>generic</i> and <i>independently</i> useful.
            A recipe distributed from this site will
            also run and execute on any system that has the required bioinformatics installed.
        </p>

        <p>
            Besides storing, sharing and executing data analysis scripts, our software supports public and private
            project-based workflows and can provide complete data storage and management solutions as a laboratory
            information management system. Each <b>project</b> is a collection of:

            <ul>
                <li><i class="file text icon"></i> Data</li>
                <li><i class="setting icon"></i> Recipes</li>
                <li><i class="bar chart icon"></i> Results</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            The application is designed to serve sequencing facilities and has been
            deployed and tested within the Penn State Bioinformatics Consulting Center.
