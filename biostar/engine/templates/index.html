                Life sciences are experiencing a <strong>reproducibility crisis</strong>. It has become
                unexpectedly challenging to even understand how analyses are performed and even more
                difficult to repeat the same process again.
            </p>

            <p>
                This site was designed to help scientists share, document, distribute and rerun
                data analysis scripts. We call these scripts <b>recipes</b> that must adhere to the following requirements:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each recipe must be fully operational.
                </li>
             <li>
                    Each recipe must have test data and results associated with it. Hence
                    demonstrating the input requirements as well as the results of the process.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each recipe may be modified, changed and shared across different projects.
                </li>

            </ul>

                The software that runs this site is called the <b>biostar-engine</b> and it does not favor any particular approach or methodology.
                Yet it allows users to create <strong>full data analysis pipelines</strong>
                that produce the desired results in just a single step.
            </p>

            <p> The software supports running command line oriented tools via a graphical user interfaces generated
                from each recipe using a JSON specification syntax.

            </p>

            <p>
                Users may adapt and remix
                recipes to match their needs, then they may share them back on the site.
                By supporting these interactions we foster
                a collaborative environment that facilitates productive interactions
                and creativity.
