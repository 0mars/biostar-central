                Life sciences are experiencing a <strong>reproducibility crisis</strong>. It has become
                unexpectedly challenging to even understand how analyses are performed and even more
                difficult to repeat the same process again.
            </p>

            <p>
                This site was designed to help scientists share, document, distribute and rerun
                data analysis scripts. We call these scripts <b>recipes</b> that must adhere to the following requirements:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Every recipe must be documented and fully operational.
                </li>
             <li>
                    Every recipe must have test data and results associated with it to
                    demonstrate the input requirements as well as the results.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Every recipe may be modified, changed, reused and shared across different projects.
                </li>

            </ul>

            <p>
                Notably the software is able to generate a graphical user interface
                from each recipe when these contain a JSON specification syntax.

                The software that runs this site is called the <b>Biostar Engine</b>. It is a software designed to
                allow users to create, run, modify and share <strong>entire data analysis pipelines</strong>.
                </p>

            <p> The <b>Biostar Engine</b>
                does not favor any particular approach or methodology and it integrates with a wide variety of tools
                and technologies. Bioinformaticians should think of the software as
                the means of deploying their existing utility to reach wider audiences.
            </p>



            <p>
                Users may adapt and remix
                recipes to match their needs, then they may share them back on the site.
                By supporting these interactions we foster
                a collaborative environment that facilitates productive interactions
                and creativity.
