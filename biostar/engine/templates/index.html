            Bioinformatics is experiencing a <em>reproducibility crisis</em>. It has become challenging to
            understand how analyses are performed and even more difficult to replicate the same processes again.

        </p>

        <p>
            This web application allows scientists to document, execute
            and share data analysis scripts. We call these analysis scripts
            <em>recipes</em>.

        </p>
        <p>

            Visit the <a href="{% url 'project_list' %}"> <i class="database icon"></i>Project List</a> to see recipes
            accessible to you.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            Users may adapt, modify and remix recipes to match
            their needs, then share these on the same site. By supporting these interactions, we foster a collaborative
            environment that facilitates creativity, efficiency and reproducibility.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that the recipes are <em>generic</em> and their use <i>is not limited</i> to the this website.
            A recipe from this site can be executed on any system that has the required bioinformatics tools installed.

        <p>
            The software that runs this site is called the<a href="https://github.com/biostars/biostar-engine">Biostar
            Engine</a> and it was designed
            to generate <em>an easy-to-use graphical interface</em> to command line tools
            and thus make these accesible to wider audiences.
        </p>


        <p>
            Besides storing, sharing and executing data analysis scripts, our software supports public and private
            <em>project-based</em> workflows and can provide a data storage and management solution as a laboratory
            information management system (LIMS).
        <p>Each project is a collection of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><i class="file text icon"></i> Data</li>
            <li><i class="setting icon"></i> Recipes</li>
            <li><i class="bar chart icon"></i> Results</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            The application is designed to serve sequencing facilities and has been
            deployed and tested within the <em>Penn State Bioinformatics Consulting Center</em>.
