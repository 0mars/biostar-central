            Bioinformatics is experiencing a <em>reproducibility impasse</em>. It has become
            difficult to understand how analyses are performed and even more challenging to adapt and reuse the
            same work-flows on different data.
        </p>

        <p>
            This web application was designed address the <em>challenges of reproducibility</em>.
            It allows scientists to document, execute
            and share data analysis scripts and the results of running these scripts. We call these analysis scripts
            <em>recipes</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Users may adapt, modify and remix recipes to match
            their needs, then share these on the same site. By supporting these interactions, we aim to foster a collaborative
            environment that facilitates creativity, efficiency and reproducibility.
        </p>

        <p>
            Recipes are <b>generic</b> and <b>universal</b>. The use of recipes is not restricted to this site. All our recipes are designed so that they run
            on any computer be that Linux, MacOS or Windows.
        </p>

        <p>
            We support what we call the <b>Freedom of Discovery</b> - where scientists are not
            limited and constrained to a platform, an interface, or a predetermined way of action.
            Science will progress only when scientists can make their own discoveries their own ways
            on their own system.
        </p>

        <p>

            Visit the <a href="{% url 'project_list' %}"> <i class="database icon"></i>Project List</a> to see recipes
            that we have deployed and shared.

            The software that runs this site is called the<a href="https://github.com/biostars/biostar-engine">Biostar
            Engine</a> and it was designed
            to generate <em>an easy-to-use interface</em> to command line scripts. These scripts may be
            executed through <code>bash</code>, <code>python</code>, <code>R</code>, <code>makefiles</code> and trough other tools. In
            addition the site collects the files that are generated
            during the run of a script and shows them to the user in an visual manner.
        </p>


        <p>
            Besides storing, sharing and executing data analysis scripts, our software supports public and private
            <em>project-based</em> workflows and can provide a data storage and management solution as a laboratory
            information management system (LIMS) for individual labs, research groups, organizations.

        <p>
            The application was also designed to serve the training requirements for researchers that need learn how
            to perform sequencing data analysis and is being used in graduate level education.
