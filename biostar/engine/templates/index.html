                Life sciences are experiencing a <i>data reproducibility crisis</i>. It has become
                challenging understand how most analyses were performed and even more
                difficult to repeat the same process on the same or on different data.
            </p>

            <p>
                This site was designed and built to help scientists share, document, distribute and rerun
                data analysis scripts. We call these scripts <b>recipes</b> that follow these requirements:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Each recipe must be fully operational.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each recipe may be modified, changed and shared across different projects.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each recipe has test data associated with it demonstrating the starting information
                        and the results of the recipe.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            </p>

            <p> Users may adapt and remix
                recipes to match their own needs, then share them as an alternative.
                By supporting these interactions we foster
                a collaborative environment that facilitates productive interactions
                and creativity. Learn more about the way <a href="{% url 'info' %}"> this site works.</a>
