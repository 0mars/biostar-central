                Life sciences are experiencing a <i>data reproducibility crisis</i>. It has become
                unexpectedly challenging
                to even understand how a given data analysis was performed let alone
                repeating or applying the same process to a new and different data.
                We have set out to address this problem.
            </p>

            <p>
                This site was designed and built to share, document, distribute and rerun
                data analysis scripts that we call <b>recipes</b>. Recipes have the
                following requirements:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Each recipe is fully operational.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each recipe can be modified, tuned and copied across different projects.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each recipe comes with test data and example output results.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            </p>

            <p> Users may adapt and remix
                recipes to match their own needs, then share them as an alternative.
                By supporting these interactions we foster
                a collaborative environment that facilitates productive interactions
                and creativity. Learn more about the way <a href="{% url 'info' %}"> this site works.</a>
