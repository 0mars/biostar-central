                Life sciences are experiencing a data reproducibility crisis. It is unexpectedly difficult
                to even understand how a given data analysis was performed let alone
                repeat or apply the same process to a new and different dataset.
            </p>
            <p>

                This site was designed and built to share, document, distribute and rerun
                data analysis scripts that we call <b>recipes</b>.

                Each recipe is fully operational! Each recipe can be modified, tuned and copied across different projects!
                Each recipe comes with test data and example output results that
                allows users understand what the inputs and the outcomes of
                each analysis recipes are.
            </p>

            <p>
                The site allows its users to easily re-rerun, share, modify and improve each-others recipes in
                a transparent manner. By supporting these interactions we foster
                a collaborative environment that facilitates productive interactions
                and creativity. Learn more about the way <a href="{% url 'info' %}"> this site works.</a>
