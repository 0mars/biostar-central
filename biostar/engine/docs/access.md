# Why am I being denied access?

Not all actions are available to all users.

When a project is created the project administrator will be able to add people to their 
projects with different access levels.

# How to stop being denied access?

Create a new project. This project will be yours and you will have 
full access to it. 

You can copy recipes and data into your project, 
you can run these recipes, and you will 
be able to upload data under a certain size.

# What kinds of access levels exist?

Project owners have the option to limit access to their project at the following
levels of granularity:

1. No access to project (private project)
2. Read project content
3. Read recipe code in project
4. Execute recipe in project
5. Edit information in project
6. Upload data into project
7. Administer project

The permissions are hierarchical. Each rank includes all permissions at lower rank. 
For example the `Upload data` permission will also include `Execute Recipe` permissions (and all other
lower ranks).

# Which recipes can I execute in my own project?

You can execute any unmodified and already authorized recipe once you copy it into your project.

# Can I execute my code in my own project?

No. You can only execute recipes that have been previously authorized by the owners of the site.

# Why can't I run my own recipe right away?

A recipe runs with full access rights on the computer. It can be easily circumvented for other nefarious purposes.
To ensure the security of the site the owners of the site must audit any new recipe.

# What does `REVIEW REQUIRED` mean?

This label is attached to any recipe that has been modified. As long as you
don't modify an authorized recipe you may execute it. Once you modify a 
recipe a staff member needs to review the code and authorize 
the recipe before it can be run on the site.

# Can I share un-reviewed recipes?

Yes. But you and the users can only test it on their computers only.

# Is this review process really necessary?

Unfortunately yes. 

# What is a Public project?

A **Public** project allows `Read recipe` access to every visitor to the site.

# What is a Private project?

A **Private** project may only be accessed by the people 
added to the project by the administrator.

# How do I become an **Administrator** on a project?

When you create a new project or when an existing project administrator adds you to their project with **Administrator** permissions.

# How do I upload large files?
