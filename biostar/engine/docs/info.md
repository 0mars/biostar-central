
## What is a recipe?

* Every recipe must be documented and fully operational.
* Every recipe must have test data and results associated with it to
demonstrate the input requirements as well as the results.
* Every recipe may be modified, changed, reused and 
shared across different projects.
            
Notably the software is able to generate a graphical user interface
from each recipe when these contain a JSON specification syntax.

## How to use recipes?

Users may adapt and remix recipes to match their needs, 
then they may share them back on the site. 
By supporting these interactions we foster a collaborative 
environment that facilitates productive interactions and creativity.

                        
## The Biostar Engine
              
The software that runs this site is called the **Biostar Engine**. It is a software designed to
allow users to create, run, modify and share *entire data analysis pipelines*

The **Biostar Engine** does not favor any particular approach or methodology and it integrates with a wide variety of tools
and technologies. Bioinformaticians should think of the software as
the means of deploying their existing utility to reach wider audiences.
