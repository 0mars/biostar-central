  <div class="title">Welcome to Biostar</div>
  
   <div class="par">
            This site's focus is bioinformatics, computational genomics and biological data analysis. As long as your question is:
  </div>

  <ul>
    <li>detailed and specific</li>
    <li>written clearly and simply</li>
    <li>of interest to at least one other person somewhere</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="par">
    it is welcome here. No question is too trivial or too "newbie". Please look around to see if your 
    question has already been asked (perhaps even answered!) before you ask. But if you end up asking a question that has 
    been asked before, that is OK too. Other users will hopefully edit in links to related or similar questions to help 
    future visitors find their way.
