    <h3>Account Merging</h3>
    We are migrating over accounts from the old BioStar server. The process should
    be automatic and you should retain all posts and votes. Your reputation is now
    computed differently, it is now the sum of all upvotes and accepted answers
    that your posts have received.

   <div class="par">
    <h3>Did we make a mistake?</h3>
    The automated merge may fail to recognize previous users.
    To request an account merge, please find the user ids for both accounts (top of the profile page) and enter them
    into the fields below then press the submit button. The <b>Master ID</b> is the account you wish to keep. The
    <b>Remove ID</b> is the user id for the
    account you wish to merge into the master. An adminstrator will review the request
    and if approved will make the change. For speedy approval make sure that your
    emails on both accounts match.
