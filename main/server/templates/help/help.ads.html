        <h3>Creating an Ad</h3>

        <div class="par">
            To create a new ad select the <b>New Post</b> button and select the <b>Ad</b> category. The title of your post
            will constitute the line that will be shown as the ad. The body of your posts will
            be a regular Biostar post that users can access after clicking the link and should contain further
            information on the advertised product.
        </div>

        <div class="par">
            Ads have three stages <code>Stopped</code>, <code>Pending</code>, <code>Active</code>.

            Upon creating your ad it will have the <code>Pending</code> status and it will need to be activated to be shown
            within the Ad rotation.
            Ads in the <code>running</code> state will be shown in the top bar. Every twenty seconds the site loads up the
            the 10 least shown ads and will select from them for the next 20 seconds. The `rate` field for ads shows the number
            of times an ads was shown in the last hour. Ideally this number is equal to to all ads. New ads will quickly catch up
            upon creation.
        </div>

        <h3>Launching and Stopping Ads</h3>

        <div class="par">
            To see a list of all ads visit the <a href="/show/ads/">ads</a> tab.
            If you have sufficient permissions then clicking the word <code>change</code>
            for your ad will toggle its state to the next one in the succession of <code>Stopped -> Pending -> Active -> Stopped ...</code>
            <b>Note:</b> depending on your permission rights you may be able to stop your own ad but not reactivate it.
        </div>

    <h3>Expiration</h3>

        <div class="par">
            Ads expire after one month and at that point will be placed in
            the <code>Stopped</code> state. Users will need to reactivate the ad by clicking the <code>change</code>.
