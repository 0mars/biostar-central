<h2 id="General">General</h2>

<h3 id="G1">What is the difference between the support site and the bioc-devel mailing list?</h3>
<p>Do not post to both locations! The support site is for questions related to
  usage of <i>Bioconductor</i> packages and troubleshooting; This site is appropriate
  for most questions. For guidance on developing a <i>Bioconductor</i>
  package, including current and future implementation of functions and
  features, please use
  the <a href="https://bioconductor.org/help/support/#bioc-devel">bioc-devel
  mailing list</a></p>

<h3 id="G2">What questions should I post?</h3>
<p>The support site is for questions related to usage of <i>Bioconductor</i>
  packages. <i>Bioconductor</i> package maintainers are required upon submission to
  subscribe to the support site and are expected to answer questions regarding
  their packages at this location. General questions about bioinformatics,
  computational genomics, biological data analysis and software unrelated to
  Bioconductor can be asked on <a href="https://www.biostars.org">biostars</a>
  or <a href="http://seqanswers.com/">seqanswers</a>. General R questions can
  be asked on the <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help">R-help
  mailing list</a>
  or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r">StackOverflow</a>.</p>

<h3 id="G3">How do I contact you?</h3>
<p>Those of us who maintain this site read the posts that are made
here.  So users who wish to contact us are encouraged to post to this
site.</p>

<h3 id="G4">What if I find a bug with the support site?</h3>
<p>No site is perfect and you may come across things that you feel are
not working as they should be.  This site is based on a fork of
Biostars so we have the power to correct many problems as they are
discovered.  If you find a problem with this website, we ask that you
please post such questions to our github repository for
it <a href="https://github.com/Bioconductor/support.bioconductor.org/issues">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="G5">Where can I suggest new features to the support site?</h3>
<p>New feature requests can be made by opening an issue on the github
  repository for this
  site <a href="https://github.com/Bioconductor/support.bioconductor.org/issues">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="G6">What about offensive content?</h3>
<p>Users posting content that does not belong to the site will be notified and
  required to edit their content. Users may post job postings to the 'Jobs'
  section as long as the topic aligns with the main focus of this site.  Users
  posting obvious spam will be immediately suspended or banned. Moderators will
  try to remove offensive content in a timely fashion but if you find something
  offensvie please notify webmaster@bioconductor.org. Post not relating to
  <i>Bioconductor</i> content will generally be removed by moderators.</p>




<h2 id="Posts">Posts</h2>

<h3 id="P1">How do I write good posts?</h3>
<p>One of the biggest things that new users struggle with is how to ask
  questions in a way that allows people to answer them.  So if you are
  unfamiliar please have a look at
  the <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/help/mailing-list/posting-guide/">posting
  guide</a> for some great advice and
  the <a href="https://support.bioconductor.org/p/117436/">tutorial</a> for help
  on using the markdown editor.
  <br>
  If a <i>Bioconductor</i> package reports an error that you cannot debug and are
  requesting assistance, Please check and include the following:
  <ul>
    <li>That <code>BiocManager::valid()</code> reports your packages are of the
    correct version.</li>
    <li>Record the output of <code>traceback()</code> immediately after the
    error occurs.</li>
    <li>Include the output of <code>sessionInfo()</code>.</li>
    <li>Provide minimal code necessary to try and reproduce the
    issue. StackOverflow has suggestions for making
    a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example">reproducible
    example</a>.</li>
  </ul>

</p>

<h3 id="P2">How do I format a post?</h3>
<p>The support site usese a markdown editor. There is a useful tutorial post
  with additional helpful links
  found <a href="https://support.bioconductor.org/p/117436/">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="P3">How do I put images into my posts?</h3>
<p>You can also put images and plots into your posts.  All you need to
do is create (or login to) a free account with http://imgur.com and
upload any images or plots that you want to share.  Then you can enter
the imgur generated 'Direct Link' url into the 'URL' location that is
available when you click on the 'image' button in the text editor.
The plot will be imbedded right into your post.</p>

<h3 id="P4">What post tags are automatically suggested?</h3>
<p> When creating a post, a user is required to enter at least one 'Post
  Tag'. There will be automatically suggested tags. These tags are generated
  from the current list of <i>Bioconductor</i> packages as well
  as <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/BiocViews.html">biocViews</a>.</p>

<h3 id="P5">How can I keep track of topics that interest me?</h3>
<p>This site offers two ways to track posts when they use certain
tags. You can add the tags that you want tracked into your user
profile. 'My Tags' will put posts that match your tagging criteria
into a special tab that you can check whenever you log in.  And
'Watched Tags' should actually email you whenever someone posts using
a tag that you are interested in. </p>

<h3 id="P6">What are the different post types?</h3>
<p>When <a href="http://support.bioconductor.org/new/post/">ASK A QUESTION</a>
  is selected there are four options. Most often a user should keep the "Ask a
  question" as the selected 'Post Type'. The four options are:
  <ul>
    <li>Ask a question: For general questions and help</li>
    <li>Post a Job Opening: For recruiting new hires by posting open job
    opportunities for a related field appropriate to the <i>Bioconductor</i> community</li>
    <li>Share a Tutorial: Share a tutorial for a bioinformatic analysis or
    <i>Bioconductor</i> package</li>
    <li>Announce News: Announce breaking news about <i>Bioconductor</i> or package
    to the community at large</li>
  </ul>
 </p>

<h3 id="P7">How do I post a Job, Tutorial, or News item?</h3>
<p>Follow the <a href="http://support.bioconductor.org/new/post/">ASK A
    QUESTION</a> link and choose the appropriate field in the 'Post Type' drop
    down box.</p>

<h3 id="P8">How do I filter posts?</h3>
<p> There are a number of different ways to filter posts. A user can edit their
  'My Tags' in their profile to allow specific posts in the 'My Tags' section
  of the banner. To filter the <a href="http://support.bioconductor.org/">main
  posting list</a>, a user could search for a specific term in the search field
  above the post listings. A user could also filter using the 'Limit' and
  'Sort' drop down boxes above the post listings.</p>




<h2 id="Account">Account</h2>

<h3 id="A1">How do I merge multiple previous acccounts?</h3>
<p>So perhaps you have been using the Bioconductor mailing list for a
long time and during that time you have been using multiple different
aliases.  And now you would like to consolidate things so that you can
get credit for actually being only one person.  What should you do?
Well 1st of all you should get set up with the account that you
normally use.  If you have not logged in before this may mean going
straight to password recovery.</p>

<p>Once you can log in, you will want to click on your name and
then go to the little blue button that is called 'Social Login'.  Here
you should be able to link in other social accounts that you may have
used before (such as gmail) to your primary account email.</p>

<p>If it turns out that your previous aliases are not listed as
optional social logins (as may happen if they were associated with
different academic institutions) then you will need to email us
at <a href="mailto:webmaster@bioconductor.org">webmaster@bioconductor.org</a>
and send us a file.  This file needs to contain a single line that
looks like this: email1 email2 email3 etc.  Essentially, this file
should contain one email for each account you wish to merge (separated
by whitespace). And the very first email that it lists must be the one
that you want to regularly use as your primary account for this
site.</p>

<h3 id="A2">User reputation</h3>
<p>The number next to a user&#39;s name is the sum of upvotes and
accepted answers that user has collected.  Upvotes boost your
reputation on the site.</p>

<h3 id="A3">How do I edit my profile?</h3>
<p>Navigate to your user account by either clicking on your name or go to the 
  <a href="http://supportupgrade.bioconductor.org/community/">list of
  users</a>, search for your user name, and click on it. From this page, you
  should be able to select 'Edit profile' under your gravatar/profile picture.
</p>

<h3 id="A4">How do I update my profile picture?</h3>
<p></p>

<h3 id="A5">What is a handle and how do I update it?</h3>
<p>A handle is a convenient way for other users to tag you in a post so you
  receive a email notification regarding the posting. If a users handle was
  'user1', anyone could tag the user in a post with '@user1'. This triggers an
  email notification for the post. A user can change their handle by editing
  their profile. See previous section on editing profile.</p>

<h3 id="A6">What are the different notification options?</h3>
<p>When editing your profile there are different notification options to choose
  from. The following describe the options: 
  <ul>
    <li>Default:</li>
    <li>Email:</li>
    <li>Local Messages:</li>
    <li>No Messages:</li>
  </ul>

</p>

<h3 id="A7">What is the different between 'My Tags' and 'Watched Tags'?</h3>
<p>'My Tags' controls which posts can be seen in the 'My Tags' tab. Any post
  with the tags listed will show up in the tab. 'Watched Tags' controls email
  postings. Any post with these tags will trigger an email notification about
  the post. It is expected that package maintainers have their package selected
  for at minimum 'Watched Tags'.</p>

<h3 id="A8">Does selecting a digest option change my notification option?</h3>
<p></p>

<h3 id="A9">How are awards generated?</h3>
<p>Awards are triggered automatically by performing actions or reaching
  milestones required for the award.</p>

<h3 id="A10">What awards are available to earn?</h3>
<p></p>

<h3 id="A11">Becoming a moderator</h3>
<p>Moderators are selected by <i>Bioconductor</i> core team members. The
  responsibility of moderating posts is given to long-term trusted
  users.</p>




<h2 id="Banner">Banner</h2>

<h3 id="B1">What shows up in 'Messages'?</h3>
<p>The Messages tab shows awards earned and comments on posts.</p>

<h3 id="B2">What shows up in 'Votes'?</h3>
<p>The Votes tab shows posts that have received an upvote, accepted answer, or
  if someone has bookmarked your post.</p>

<h3 id="B3">What shows up in 'My Posts'</h3>
<p>Any post that you have created, answered or commented appear in this tab. </p>

<h3 id="B4">What shows up in 'My Tags'</h3>
<p>Any post with the tags identified in 'My Tags' of a user's profile are listed
  under this tab. These can be edited by updating/editing your user profile.</p>

<h3 id="B5">What shows up in 'Follow'?</h3>
<p></p>

<h3 id="B6">What shows up in 'Bookmarks'? / How do I bookmark a post?</h3>
<p>After selecting a post, there is a bookmark icon underneath the upvote count
  for the main post, as well as any answer, comment, or reply. </p>

<h3 id="B7">What does selecting a digest option do? Does it effect my notification option?</h3>
<p></p>
