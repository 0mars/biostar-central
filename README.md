# The Biostar Engine

Software for Better Science.

The **Biostar Engine** is a [Python][python] and [Django][django] web application for supporting scientific data analysis.

See the site in operation:

## What does the software do?

The **Biostar Engine** can execute scripts, it can capture and show you the results of running the script.

The scripts may be written in `bash`, may be a `Makefile`, may be `R` commands, just about any code that could be executed from command line. We call the scripts that the engine can execute *recipes*. In summary the Biostar Engine is able to:

1. Generate a graphical user interface for a script.
1. Manage the input data needed for the script.
1. Execute a command line script
1. Manage the resulting files generated by the script

## How does the software work?

In a nutshell, a recipe is created via an interface specification file (json) and a script template (written in bash, R etc).

The site generates the web interface from the interface specification file. Users can make selections in the web interface, these selections are then passed down into the script template.

## What is the purpose of the software?

The **Biostar Engine** was designed for processing large projects composed of tens/hundreds/thousands of files. The eninge is able to represent data in a generalized way. For example, all files of a sequencing run may be represented by just one *single* data entry.
